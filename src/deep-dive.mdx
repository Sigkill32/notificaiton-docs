# Deep Dive

## An All in one component

Spawn either message or notification component by using the same component by setting the ```type``` prop to ```message``` or ```notification```.

```jsx
 type: 'notification'
```
<h3 style="text-align: center">or</h3>

 ```jsx
 type: 'message'
 ```

## Choose between notification types

Render either ```success```, ```error```, ```info``` or ```warn``` message to the user by using the following syntax. Use openNotification to render components without any icons.

```jsx
notification.success(config) // Render success notification

notification.error(config) // Render error notification

notification.info(config) // Render info notification

notification.warn(config) // Render warning notification

notification.openNotification(config) // Render notification without an icon
```

## Exercise better control over your component's look

Tweak the look and feel of your component by defining a custom class using ```className``` prop.

```jsx
className: /* your class name */
```

## The onNotificationClick and onNotificationClose callbacks

Use the onNotificationClick and onNotificationClose callbacks to define further actions after user performs these actions on the notification component. Both the callbacks have id's of the notification component as arguments.

```jsx
notification.success({
    .....
    onNotificationClick: handleNotificationClick
    onNotificationClose: handleNotificationClose
})

handleNotificationClick = id => {
    // perform actions on clicking the component
}

handleNotificationClose = id => {
    // perform actions on closing the component
}
```

## The closeNotification function

Close a notification component from anywhere by passing the id of the notification to the closeNotification function.

```jsx
notification.closeNotification(id) //closeNotification
```

## Close duration

Control the close duration of a component by specifying the duration within which the component closes. The default close duration is 2000ms. Set the ```duration``` prop to 0 to have infinite closing time.

```jsx
notification.openNotification({
    ....
    duration: // 0: infinite close time, 0> : closes in specified time, undefined: closes in 2000ms
})

## Animate notification opening

import ```animations.css``` from the ```dist/``` directory to apply animations to your notification component.
```
